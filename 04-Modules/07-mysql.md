## Explanation of key tasks

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Install MySQL server

```yaml
- name: install
  ansible.builtin.dnf:
    name: mysql-server
    state: installed
```

**Module**: `dnf`
**Purpose**: Installs `mysql-server` package from OS repositories.

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Start and enable MySQL service

```yaml
- name: start mysql server
  ansible.builtin.service:
    name: mysqld
    state: started
    enabled: yes
```

**Module**: `service`
**Purpose**: Starts MySQL server (`mysqld`) and ensures it is enabled to start on system boot.

---

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Setup root password (secure installation)

```yaml
- name: setup root password
  ansible.builtin.command: mysql_secure_installation --set-root-pass RoboShop@1
```

**Module**: `command`
**Purpose**: Runs `mysql_secure_installation` with `--set-root-pass` option to set the MySQL root password (`RoboShop@1`).
This is part of the initial hardening process of a new MySQL installation.

## Why This Playbook Is Useful

* Automates the **installation of MySQL server** ‚Äî no need to manually install and configure it.
* Ensures **MySQL is running** and set to start on boot.
* Automates the **secure configuration** of MySQL (root password setup), reducing the risk of human error.
* Saves time when setting up MySQL across multiple environments (Dev, QA, Production).

## Real-World Scenario

üëâ In an eCommerce microservices app, components like **shipping** and **payment** typically use **MySQL** as their relational database.

üëâ DevOps can use this playbook to:

‚úÖ Quickly provision new **MySQL database servers**
‚úÖ Automate **initial MySQL setup and security hardening**
‚úÖ Ensure **consistent configuration** across environments
‚úÖ Prepare databases for **application data** (tables, schemas, initial seed data can be added as next steps)

üëâ This is very useful for **repeatable infrastructure deployments**, CI/CD pipelines, and even disaster recovery (where new DB servers must be provisioned rapidly).
